✅ Let me know if you'd like:
- Sample Firebase Firestore structure (collections: `plants`, `community_posts`, etc.)
- Dummy CSV/JSON data to import
- AI model upgrade for health prediction
- GitHub push + `live demo` guide (Streamlit Cloud / HuggingFace Spaces)

Just say **“SHOW FIREBASE STRUCTURE”** or **“DEPLOY TO GITHUB”** or **“NEXT STEP”** — I’ll guide you line by line.
